Studying file processing using spring batch

This project involves developing an application capable of registering customers either manually or through file processing.

To accomplish this task, the following technologies were utilized:

* Java 11: The core programming language.<br>
* Spring Boot: A framework for building Spring applications.<br>
* Spring Batch: A framework for batch processing.<br>
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing customer data.<br>
* MySQL: A relational database for storing Spring Batch metadata.<br>
* Lombok: A library for reducing boilerplate code.<br>

Spring Batch was employed to configure the job, read the file, process the data, and save it to MongoDB.
 MySQL was used to store metadata generated by Spring Batch. Lombok was utilized to streamline development by reducing repetitive code.
